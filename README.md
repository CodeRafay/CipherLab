# CipherLab
Web app using Streamlit to implement various substitution and transposition cipher techniques. Users can input plaintext, select a cipher (like Caesar, Vigenère, or Hill), enter relevant parameters, and view both the ciphertext and step-by-step encryption process. It’s modular, with each cipher in a separate Python file for easy extension.
